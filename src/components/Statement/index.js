                <Subtitle lightText> - Creating My First Site -</Subtitle>
                <Text>
                  Choosing to create a website from scratch was an opportunity
                  for myself to do something for the first time. This was a
                  learning experience like no other. A week before comitting
                  myself to the idea, I had just started learning for my résumé
                  Facebook’s JavaScript library React. This was a big change
                  from what my Wayne State classes taught me, C++ and Java, and
                  presented a great challenge. The day of this project’s due
                  date came fast though, and I thought that putting 15 hours or
                  so would be enough to learn and create a site. However, once I
                  started putting components of the idea I had in my head
                  together in code, everything kept breaking. My site going into
                  that Monday was a page of animated text boxes that opened when
                  you tapped them with information and pictures inside.
                  <VideoBg
                    playsInline
                    autoPlay
                    loop
                    muted
                    src={Video}
                    type="video/mp4"
                  />
                </Text>
              </TextWrapper>
            </Form>
          </Column1>
        </InfoWrapper>
      </Container>
      <Container>
        <InfoWrapper>
          <Column1>
            <Form>
              <TextWrapper>
                <Text>
                  Whenever I tried to add any other element, this design broke
                  down, and Tuesday morning I decided to scrap everything and
                  start clean with a basic UI focusing on clear sections. This
                  is when I decided I would do a head section and 4 smaller
                  sections that could be accessed via navbar. I also wanted to
                  challenge myself and figure out how to travel to a different
                  page (adding Author Statement this took me about 4 hours). 
                  <Subtitle lightText>In the end it took about 40 hours,
                   26 files, 11 images and 2 font downloads</Subtitle>
                  But it is a necessary step in my software developement
                  future so it was worth it.

              </TextWrapper>
            </Form>
          </Column1>
        </InfoWrapper>
      </Container>
      <Container>
      <NavBtn>
      </NavBtn>
        <InfoWrapper>
          <Column1>
            <Form>
              <TextWrapper>
                <Text>
                  For the final version of the website, my idea was to treat it
                  as professional as I could for job applications, unfortunately
                  it was restricted by my poor time management, because in Web
                  Development an applicant having their own website for their
                  résumé is the norm. It isn’t perfect, but the base I built is
                  scalable to add more components in the future. My next step
                  would be to add more interactivity and animations for the
                  text, and possibly something more creative than the standard
                  navbar at the top.
